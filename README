USAGE
=====

BitcoinPayment is the most usable class currently, ignore the others.

Currently works at follow:

from django_bitcoin import BitcoinPayment, getNewBitcoinPayment, bitcoinprice
from decimal import Decimal

bp=getNewBitcoinPayment(Decimal("0.32"))
bp2=getNewBitcoinPayment(Decimal("0.99")/bitcoinprice("USD")) # convert from USD

if bp.is_paid(minconf=5):
    # send 5% of payment to bitcoin address someaddress
    bp.withdraw_proportion(someaddress, Decimal("5.0"))
    if bp.is_paid() and bp2.is_paid():
        # send from both bp and bp2 (95% from both, only single bitcoin transaction)
        BitcoinPayment.withdraw_all(someaddress2,  {bp, bp2})

NOTE
====

I don't have time to answer to email support requests, sorry guys.

The API _WILL_ change, so don't use this now unless you know what you are doing (and can fork it and develop it further yourself).
